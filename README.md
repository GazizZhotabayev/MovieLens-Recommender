# MovieLens Recommender - System

What I implemented on the right is a recommender system thatâ€™s using item-based collaborative filtering. The basic idea behind it is - if you say two movies both suck / are both mediocre / are both awesome - then this is pointing to some real similarity between the two. In other words, the fact that the same user (you) gave them the same rating, means that this pair of movies clearly both cater (or both do not cater) to the same kind of taste (yours). Now extrapolate this to thousands of users - one can get a pretty good estimation for which two movies go together.
